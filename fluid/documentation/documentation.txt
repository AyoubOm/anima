=========== Preliminaries ============

- We have two kinds of objects:
	+ The fluid particles: air, water, ...
	+ The particles that are carried by the fluid: dust, smoke, ...


- The motion of the smoke/dust/.. is determined by the velocity field of the fluid.
	"A velocity field on its own isnâ€™t really visually interesting until it starts moving objects such as
smoke particles, dust or leaves."

3- "Light objects such as dust are usually just carried along with the velocity field: they simply follow the velocity."

1- "In the case of smoke, it is prohibitively expensive to model every particle. Hence in this case the smoke particles are replaced by a smoke density"

2- "The evolution of the density field through the velocity field of the fluid is described by the second equation of Navier-Stokes"


- I suppose the parameter x of "add_sources" in page 5 is the density, and s will be zeros except in cells which contain sources of (non-fluid) particles.



=========== Navier-Stokes (Programmer point of view) =============


- 2nd equation: Density comes from:
	+ A source if it exists in the unit volume
	+ The neighbor units of volume, and density in the unit volume is tranferred to neighbors (diffusion)
	+ Due to dynamic fluid, this density will go to another unit of volume and this unit of volume will get the density of another one (advection)



- The first equation described in the paper applies to any characteristic in the fluid: density, density of another material, .. The second equation applies this equation to the density of the material introduced in the fluid. 






========== Algorithm steps ===========

- "To summarize, this does the following steps:
		1- Diffuse all three velocity components.
		2- Fix up velocities so they keep things incompressible
		3- Move the velocities around according to the velocities of the fluid (confused yet?).
		4- Fix up the velocities again
		5- Diffuse the dye.
		6- Move the dye around according to the velocities." - mikeash.com

		What is the difference between the diffusion in 1 and in 5 ?


- edge cases (boundaries of the grid):
	-> the horizontal component of the velocity should be zero on the vertical walls
	-> the vertical component of the velocity should be zero on the horizontal walls


======== Questions =========

- What is the density in Navier-Stokes, is it density of the fluid ?
	-> No, it's the density of the material introduced in the fluid.

- For smoke, how do we compute the density of the smoke in a unit volume based on the density of the fluid in that volume ?

- Shouldn't we divide by 4 normally here x0[IX(i-1,j)]+x0[IX(i+1,j)]+x0[IX(i,j-1)]+x0[IX(i,j+1)]-4*x0[IX(i,j)] for computing the net new density ?

- a = dt * diff * N * N ?

- "For large diffusion rates a the density values start to oscillate, become negative and finally diverge, making the simulation useless". Why does this happen ?

- How do we know that the other method is stable ?



======= Bonus Questions =======

- "The Navier-Stokes equations can be solved analytically for only a few simple physical configurations". Why ?
