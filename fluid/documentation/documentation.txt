=========== Preliminaries ============

- We have two kinds of objects:
	+ The fluid particles: air, water, ...
	+ The particles that are carried by the fluid: dust, smoke, ...


- Here, we are not interested in visualizing the fluid, but in the objects that it carries.
	-> "Of course, moving water is really boring if there's nothing in it, because you can't see it moving!" -> I am not OK with this, waves in water can be seen...

- The motion of the smoke/dust/.. is determined by the velocity field of the fluid.
	"A velocity field on its own isnâ€™t really visually interesting until it starts moving objects such as
smoke particles, dust or leaves." - Jos Stam

3- "Light objects such as dust are usually just carried along with the velocity field: they simply follow the velocity."

1- "In the case of smoke, it is prohibitively expensive to model every particle. Hence in this case the smoke particles are replaced by a smoke density"

2- "The evolution of the density field through the velocity field of the fluid is described by the second equation of Navier-Stokes"


- I suppose the parameter x of "add_sources" in page 5 is the density, and s will be zeros except in cells which contain sources of (non-fluid) particles.



=========== Navier-Stokes (physicist point of view) =============

- Interpretation of the two equations ?

- 2nd equation: Density comes from:
	+ A source if it exists in the unit volume
	+ The neighbor units of volume, and density in the unit volume is tranferred to neighbors (diffusion)
	+ Due to dynamic fluid, this density will go to another unit of volume and this unit of volume will get the density of another one (advection)




=========== Solving Navier-Stokes equations ===============

Gauss-Seidel ?




======== Questions =========

- What is the density in Navier-Stokes, is it density of the fluid ?

- For smoke, how do we compute the density of the smoke in a unit volume based on the density of the fluid in that volume ?

- Because density is not used to compute velocity (first equation), in case of dust where it's velocity is the same as velocity of the fluid (fact 3), we don't need the second equation ?

- Shouldn't we divide by 4 normally here x0[IX(i-1,j)]+x0[IX(i+1,j)]+x0[IX(i,j-1)]+x0[IX(i,j+1)]-4*x0[IX(i,j)] for computing the net new density ?

- a = dt * diff * N * N ?

- "For large diffusion rates a the density values start to oscillate, become negative and finally diverge, making the simulation useless". Why does this happen ?

- How do we know that the other method is stable ?



======= Bonus Questions =======

- "The Navier-Stokes equations can be solved analytically for only a few simple physical configurations". Why ?
